# Cplusplus-Program
This program is built to help with organization of produce inventory. It takes a file with every individual produce product and reads it, allowing us to organize it into a new list that tells a user how many of each item there is in the current inventory. I was able to read in the the original text file and wrote the new list into a new file that could be read later on. When printing the output I seperated two seperate lists between the produce name and the quantity each produce product exists. The code could be enhanced if I had a dictionary that could store it all into one instead of the two seperate lists. The most challanging part for me with this code was when integrating the Python I realised there was alot I forgot about the langauge and had to research things I know I once used. When researching I used stackoverflow.com and glanced through some previous projects I have done. The integration its self will be very useful in the future. I could not find too much of this online and this will be amazing help if I ever have to know it in the future. In order to keep the code readable I usted some industry standard practices like inline comments and conventional name practices.
